## Security Guidelines

### For Developers

#### Code Security
1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
2. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries and ORM
3. **XSS Protection**: Escape output and use Content Security Policy
4. **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
5. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies and audit for vulnerabilities

#### Authentication & Sessions
1. **Password Handling**: Use bcrypt for password hashing
2. **Session Security**: Implement secure session management
3. **API Security**: Use proper authentication for API endpoints
4. **Token Management**: Implement secure token generation and validation

#### Data Handling
1. **Sensitive Data**: Never log sensitive information
2. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
3. **File Uploads**: Validate file types and scan for malware
4. **Database Security**: Use least privilege access and encrypted connections

### For Administrators

#### Deployment Security
1. **Environment Separation**: Keep development, staging, and production separate
2. **Secret Management**: Use environment variables or secret management systems
3. **SSL/TLS**: Implement proper SSL/TLS configuration
4. **Security Headers**: Configure all recommended security headers

#### Monitoring & Maintenance
1. **Regular Updates**: Keep all systems and dependencies updated
2. **Security Audits**: Perform regular security assessments
3. **Backup Security**: Ensure backups are encrypted and tested
4. **Incident Response**: Have an incident response plan ready

### For Users

#### Account Security
1. **Strong Passwords**: Use unique, complex passwords
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enable MFA when available
3. **Regular Reviews**: Review account activity regularly
4. **Secure Access**: Only access the platform from trusted devices

#### Data Protection
1. **Privacy Settings**: Review and configure privacy settings
2. **Data Sharing**: Be cautious about sharing sensitive information
3. **Phishing Awareness**: Be aware of phishing attempts
4. **Logout**: Always log out from shared devices

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Process

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** disclose the vulnerability publicly
2. **Email** our security team at security@festival-planner.example.com
3. **Include** detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **Provide** steps to reproduce the issue if possible

### What to Include

Your report should include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Affected versions or components
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

We commit to:
- **Acknowledge** receipt within 24 hours
- **Initial assessment** within 72 hours
- **Regular updates** every 7 days
- **Resolution** based on severity level

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Critical | Remote code execution, data breach | 24 hours |
| High | Privilege escalation, authentication bypass | 72 hours |
| Medium | Information disclosure, CSRF | 7 days |
| Low | Security misconfigurations | 30 days |

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing

We implement automated security testing including:
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container security scanning
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security scanning

### Manual Testing

Regular manual security assessments include:
- Penetration testing
- Code review
- Architecture security review
- Social engineering assessment

### Bug Bounty Program

We may implement a bug bounty program in the future. Details will be published here when available.

## Compliance

### Standards & Frameworks
