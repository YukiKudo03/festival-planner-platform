This comprehensive security audit identified and resolved one critical security vulnerability in the Kamal deployment configuration. The project now meets security best practices with proper sensitive data handling.

## 🎯 Audit Scope

The security audit covered:
- Git repository history and tracking
- Configuration files and environment templates
- Deployment scripts and secrets management
- File permissions and access controls
- Credential handling and storage

## 🚨 Critical Findings (RESOLVED)

### 1. Kamal Secrets Configuration Vulnerability
**File**: `.kamal/secrets:17`  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue Description**:
```bash
# Original vulnerable code
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$(cat config/master.key)
```

**Security Risk**:
- Direct file system access to sensitive master key
- Potential for key exposure during deployment
- Violation of secrets management best practices

**Resolution Applied**:
```bash
# Secure replacement
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=${RAILS_MASTER_KEY:-$(cat secrets/rails_master_key.txt 2>/dev/null || echo "MASTER_KEY_NOT_FOUND")}
```

**Security Improvements**:
- Environment variable prioritization
- Fallback to secure secrets directory
- Error handling for missing files
- Clear security documentation
